There are two forms of the minimum requirements for an Observation:<br><ol>
<li>
<i>species, date-time, location</i> (eg. I saw a Koala at Gap Road at 15:00:00 today). Adding a photo obviously helps to verify or add weight to the observation but sometimes a photo isn't possible or necessary (eg. frogs are often identified by their call and a photo is rarely possible).</li>
<li>
<i>photo, date-time, location</i>  (eg. I took a photo of a dragonfly at Lake Barracoota at 13:30:00 yesterday). If you don't know what the species is that's OK because you can do more research, ask someone, send your friends/group a <a href="home/integrate-with-existing-websites/link-to-observations.html">link to the observation</a>, etc and fill in the species bit later - or someone will see your observation and name it for you.</li>
</ol>When you click on '<a href="http://natureshare.org.au/observation/" rel="nofollow">Observations</a>' on NatureShare's main/side menu you get to a page which shows a series of about 6 random photos from NatureShare. On this page, simply click on the 'Add a new observation' box to upload an Observation. The following items then appear on this main Observation entry page:<br><ul>
<li>
<b>Upload a Photo</b><br>You don't have to upload a photo<b> </b>but it helps if you can. You can upload up to 3 photos per Observation but only the first photo gets shown in search and collection thumbnails. All 3 photos can only be viewed from within that Observation. Preferably the 3 photos would be of the same individual of the species although if info is added in the description there are instances when other individuals, forms or species can be pictured in the 2nd and 3rd photos (eg. the caterpillar if it is found on the plant where the adult butterfly is circling - or a photo of the host plant observed).<br><br>Currently, every photo uploaded to NatureShare requires the user to allocate a <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/naturesharehelp/observations/creative-commons">Creative Commons</a> sharing/copyright license. Then, browse for the photo you want to upload, bearing in mind:</li>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Crop photos</b>, etc, to maximise the usefulness of the photo. Pictures are first seen in NatureShare via thumbnail-size pictures. As an example, dragonflies, as pictured above right, are very difficult to see in thumbnail size pictures so optimally cropping photos is very important.<br>
</li>
<li>Photos must be <b>less than 3Mb</b> in size, and preferably 1-3Mb in size. The bigger the picture, the better the detail, the better for NatureShare. Note that the time it takes to upload a file is limited by your Internet connection speed.</li>
<li>
<b>JPEG</b> files are preferred.</li>
<li>Photos should primarily show <b>flora and/or fauna only</b>. Images that show people should be avoided. If required, permission of the person/people in the picture must be obtained in writing (eg. by email).</li>
<li>
<b>No watermarks</b>. No photos are allowed on NatureShare with watermarks.<br>... in addition, note that ...<br>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Date-time is uploaded automatically</b> if your camera's clock is set to the correct time. You don't need to do anything because the date-time is automatically written to what is called the EXIF file which is a part of any digital photo. NatureShare automatically extracts this info from the photo's EXIF file. Date-time can be <a href="home/how-to/correct-mistakes.html">deleted/changed</a> if the clock was wrong.<br>
</li>
<li>
<b>Geotags are </b><b> uploaded automatically</b> if you geotag your photos. Always check the location afterwards because geotags are not always accurate, especially in forested areas. Geotags and date-time are read from the photo's EXIF file.<br>

<b>Species <br></b><div style="display:inline;float:right;margin:5px 10px"><a href="https://sites.google.com/site/naturesharehelp/observations/kookaburra.jpg?attredirects=0" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="400" src="https://sites.google.com/site/naturesharehelp/_/rsrc/1298263141636/observations/kookaburra.jpg?height=400&amp;width=265" width="265"></a></div>Enter the name of the species observed, if known, either by scientific name (eg. Acacia pycnantha) or common name (eg. Golden 
Wattle). The search operates by matching the text string as you type; 
eg. by the time you have typed "kook" there are only two remaining 
options in the drop down box (including Kookaburra).<i> <br></i><ul>
<li>
<b>Important</b>: The species names for all of the plants, mammals, 
birds, frogs, snakes &amp; lizards, butterflies and dragonflies known to
 occur in Victoria are in the NatureShare database. Some moth names are 
also in the database. Observations for all the species in these groups 
are now possible in NatureShare. Other species groups will come on-line 
in the near future - keep an eye on '<a href="home/whats-new.html">What's New</a>'!</li>
<li>
<i>Quick tip</i>:
 The last three letters of the genus name and the first three letters of
 the species name is usually unique (eg. "cia pyc" for Acacia 
pycnantha). This is particularly useful for navigating through a genus 
like acacia or eucalyptus which tend to overwhelm the drop-down box 
because there are hundreds of species in the genus. Also, with practice, you can train yourself to think of just the most unique part of the species name; eg. " pyc" (note the space before pyc). The same applies 
whether it is the scientific name or common name; eg. "den wat" for 
Golden Wattle works well too.</li>
</ul>
<br>Once you have entered the species name, 
you can reload the page. This then allows you to click on the species name to go to that <a href="species-section.1.html">Species page</a>. The species name can be <a href="home/how-to/correct-mistakes.html">deleted/changed</a> on any observation page if a mistake is made.<br><br><i><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>What
if you can ID it to genus level but not to species level, etc?</i> For example,</li>
<ul>
<li>"<b><i>I know it
is a Wattle but I don't know the species</i></b>" - this is a very typical issue and there is a way you can enter 'what you know' in NatureShare. In this example, for every genus (eg. Acacia) that contains more than one species in Victoria there is a additional 'species name' added to NatureShare that is "Acacia spp.". So if you don't know what the species name is you can temporarily enter "Acacia spp.". Then you can do more research to find out the species name, ask a friend or ask your group, and/or anyone who comes across it can change the name for you at a later date. In some cases, like Acacia spp., there is a further option if know the Wattle is introduced to your area (ie. not local), that is "Acacia spp. (naturalised)".<br>
</li>
<li>"<b><i>I know it to species
level but not to subspecies or variety level</i></b>" (eg. "I know it is Drosera
peltata but not which subspecies it is") - for every instance where more than one subspecies occurs in Victoria, eg. "Drosera peltata subsp. peltata" and "Drosera peltata subsp. auriculata" (or more than one variety/var., more than one form/f., etc) there is a additional 'species name' added to NatureShare that 
is the species only (ie. "Drosera peltata") such that the options that appear in NatureShare are:<br><ul>
<li>Drosera peltata</li>
<li>Drosera peltata subsp. auriculata</li>
<li>Drosera peltata subsp. peltata</li>
</ul>So if you don't know which subspecies it is you can 
temporarily enter "Drosera peltata". Then you can do more research to find 
out the subspecies name, ask a friend or ask your group, and/or anyone who 
comes across it can change the name for you at a later date. NatureShare is designed so users can enter 'Biological Attributes' and 
'Similar Species' that help distinguish between subspecies etc, like 
in this case for "<a href="http://natureshare.org.au/species/3078_drosera_peltata_subsp_auriculata/" rel="nofollow">Drosera peltata subsp. auriculata</a>" and "<a href="http://natureshare.org.au/species/3079_drosera_peltata_subsp_peltata/" rel="nofollow">Drosera peltata subsp. peltata</a>".</li>
<li>"<i><b>s.l. or s.s.</b> - I know what the species name was before it was split but I don't know which species name applies post-split</i>" - occasionally the scientists realise that what is referred to as a particular species name is actually two or more distinct species. When this happens, species are 'split' such that the original name is retained but with a narrower distribution, and new species names are created. It takes some time for knowledge about 'splits' to filter through so this is handled via the s.l./s.s. system. Put simply, <b>s.l. refers to the pre-split</b> or old use of the name and <b>s.s. refers to the post-split</b> or new use of the name. <b>If there is doubt use "s.l."</b>, then you can do more research to find 
out which post-split name should be used, ask a friend or ask your group, and/or anyone who 
comes across it can change the name for you at a later date. Quite often (not always though), the split occurs because it is realised an isolated/remote entity differs from the main species and, more often not (but not always), the commonly known species retains its name and the remote species is given a new name (but not always - there are well established rules for which entity retains the name). Definitions for s.l. and s.s. are in the <a href="glossary.html">glossary</a>.<br>
</li>
<li>"<b><i>I know it is in the daisy family but I don't know what genus or species it is</i></b>" - for every family (eg. Asteraceae) that contains more than one genus in 
Victoria there is a additional 'species name' added to NatureShare that 
is "Asteraceae spp.". So if you know the family but don't know which genus it belongs to you can 
temporarily enter "Asteraceae spp.", etc. Then you can do more research to find 
out the genus and species name, ask a friend or ask your group, and/or anyone who 
comes across it can change the name for you at a later date.</li>
<li>"<b><i>I know it is a damselfly (or dragonfly) but I don't know any further information</i></b>" - every attempt is made in NatureShare to allow users to put in 'what they know'. Dragonflies are split into two groups (sub-orders) known as 'Dragonflies proper' (order: anisoptera) and 'Damselflies' (order: zygoptera). In NatureShare, it is possible to enter the 'species names' "Anisoptera spp." (or 'Dragonfly proper') and "Zygoptera spp." (or 'Damselfly') if you know which sub-order you observed. You can also enter the order name "Odonata spp." (or 'Dragonfly') if you just know it was a Dragonfly.<br><br>All of these 'extra' species names are known by the NatureShare team as "non-species". We intend to do more work in NatureShare to make it clearer when 'non-species' are added into NatureShare, so it is clear to the user they have entered a 'non-species' name.<br>
</li>
</ul>
</ul></div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Tags<br></b>A Tag is any
important feature of the observation/photo. Tags are very important, so much so there is a whole set of pages dedicated to <a href="observations/tags.html">Tags</a>. An example of a very important Tag for a plant
observation/photo is '<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fnatureshare.org.au%2Fobservation%2F926%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFrqEzdd22jpbdPBO8cYt7sHa_k_R246Ig">flower</a>'
 (if the Observation is of the plant when it is in flower). Entering this Tag is 
important because it will be used to build a calendar of when the
plant is in flower (NatureShare's Calendar feature is currently under
development). Other examples of a Tag include '<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fnatureshare.org.au%2Fobservation%2F966%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFrqEzdUiLgcDRyzrvcFD6SB-B_MiFAfkA">leaf</a>' (if you have uploaded
a good picture of the leaf), '<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fnatureshare.org.au%2Fobservation%2F1647%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFrqEzfthi0yZaQMlpNL0DwwREcPdG1t4A">male</a>', female or 'juvenile' (if you
observed/photographed the male, female or juvenile of the species), '<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fnatureshare.org.au%2Fobservation%2F1663%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFrqEzdyul_ubNvigMeP-eI444dyhKqzSw">mating</a>'
if
the observation is showing a mating pair, etc. Find out more about <a href="observations/tags.html">Tags</a>.<br><b><br></b>

<li>
<b>Date-Time<br></b>Date-time is uploaded automatically with a photo if your camera's clock is set to the correct time. You don't need to do anything because 
the date-time is automatically written to what is called the EXIF file 
which is a part of any digital photo. NatureShare automatically extracts
 this info from the photo's EXIF file. Date-time can be <a href="home/how-to/correct-mistakes.html">deleted/changed</a> if the clock was wrong. You can also enter the date-time manually by clicking on the 'Edit date and time' link. The date is entered by dropdown boxes and the format for time is a 24hr clock, eg. "15:30:00" for 3:30pm.<br><b><br></b>
</li>
<li>
<b>Location<br></b>There are three ways you can upload the location of your observation:</li>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Goetags</b> - Geotags are  uploaded automatically if you geotag your 
photos but always check the location afterwards because geotags are not 
always accurate, especially in forested areas. Geotags are
 read from the photo's EXIF file.</li>
<li>
<b>Enter coordinates manually</b> - by clicking on the 'Edit coordinates' text. NatureShare currently records coordinates as a decimal number (eg.&nbsp;-37.438517, 144.662422). Coordinates can be <a href="home/how-to/correct-mistakes.html">deleted/changed</a> using this method too.<br>
</li>
<li>Use the <b>Google Maps interface</b> - by clicking on the 'Show large map' text. This displays the Google Maps interface for entering the location of the observation interactively.<br>
</li>
<ul>
<li>Double-click on the approximate location on the map to zoom-in, and double-right-click to zoom out, OR, use the + - bar on the right of the map to zoom in (+) or zoom out (-), OR, drag the zoom bar up and down the + - scale as required.</li>
<li>You can move the map around by dragging on the screen (ie. holding down the mouse-click button and moving the mouse simultaneously).<br>
</li>
<li>In the empty 'Map location search' box, enter the nearest town (eg. Mallacoota) or street address (eg. 100 Main Road, Riddells Creek) to your observation and hit enter (or click on 'Find') and it will automatically zoom in to that location. Then zoom in or zoom out as detailed above.&nbsp; <br>
</li>
<li>When you are ready to pin-point your observation location, click on the 'Drop marker at map centre' box and/or drag the marker to the precise location. <b>IMPORTANT</b>: when you drag the marker a small cross (X) appears beneath it and this is where the location is when you release the marker.<br>
</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Description<br></b>This is not searchable information but important in describing what was observed, providing extra information that is not contained in the photo (eg. how many you saw, what their behaviours was, etc.). It will help others understand what you observed. Examples are provided here for observations of the <a href="http://natureshare.org.au/observation/1652/" rel="nofollow">Tau Emerald</a> dragonfly and an <a href="http://natureshare.org.au/observation/1661/" rel="nofollow">Amethyst Hairstreak</a> butterfly.<br><br>
</li>
<li>
<b>Collections<br></b>Here you can add your Observation to a Collection (or add anyone else's Observation to a collection if it is appropriate to do so). Observations should only be added to relevant collections; eg. if a plant was observed (and photo taken) while in the Grampians, then it should be added to the Plants of the Grampians Collection, and not to the Plants of the Macedon Range Collection. Adding your Observations to Collections, where they exist, is important because, when in a Collection, there are thumbnails shown of each species in that Collection and <b>priority is given to photos in Observations that are assigned to that Collection</b> (to ensure that the local form of the species is displayed). <i>You need to be a member of a Collection to add to a Collection. Also, when you click on 'Add to a collection' only the collections you are a member of are displayed</i>.<br><br>
</li>
<li>
<b>Comments<br></b>The 'Write a comment' option is designed so you can comment on the Observations of other people. Click on the 'Write a comment' text to add a comment.<br><b><br></b>

<br><i>Quick Tip</i>: When you click on '<a href="http://natureshare.org.au/observation/" rel="nofollow">Observations</a>'
 on NatureShare's main/side menu you get to a page which shows a series 
of about 6 random photos from NatureShare. Keep clicking on 
'Observations' on the side menu and the random photos change (great fun 
to just look at what amazing things we live with!). </div></div>
